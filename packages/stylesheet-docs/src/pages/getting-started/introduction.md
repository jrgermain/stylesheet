# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for my personal design system. I built this as a chance to do some design work that I could also leverage in future projects. Along the way, I learned a lot about building accessible websites and about the lesser-known elements and handy features that got added in HTML5.

All this goodness is wrapped up in a package called `@jrgermain/stylesheet`, which contains a lightweight, framework-agnostic design system written in pure CSS. Since it's just CSS, you can use it in any web project, regardless of the libraries or framework you use.

I designed this package with the following principles in mind:

- The websites I build should be **visually appealing**, **accessible**, and **cohesive**.
- Use the platform wherever possible and minimize (preferably eliminate) JavaScript needed at runtime.
- Provide the flexibility to use the right tool for each job, which could mean different frameworks for different projects (or no framework at all).

This site explains how to use this package in your project and provides examples for each component. While I don't expect others to use this, you're certainly welcome to. Plus, I've learned the importance of writing documentation for Future Me.
