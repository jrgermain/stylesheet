# Introduction

To be honest, I don't get many chances to design stuff.

That's why I decided to build my own design system. Call me a madman if you want; I just wanted a fun challenge.

Along the way, I learned a lot about building accessible websites and about the lesser-known elements and handy features that got added in HTML5. And probably a lot of other things that I forgot to mention.

That brings us to this site. This is the homepage for `@jrgermain/stylesheet`, an NPM package that contains styles used in apps I build. The goal of this package is to create a lightweight design system for my projects that isn't tied to a specific library or framework.

I designed this library with the following principles in mind:

- The websites I build should be **visually appealing**, **accessible**, and **cohesive**.
- Use the platform wherever possible and minimize (preferably eliminate) JavaScript needed at runtime.
- Provide the flexibility to use the right tool for each job, which could mean different frameworks for different projects (or no framework at all).

This site explains how to use this library in your project and provides examples for each component. While I don't expect others to use this, you're certainly welcome to. Plus, I've learned the importance of writing documentation for Future Me.
