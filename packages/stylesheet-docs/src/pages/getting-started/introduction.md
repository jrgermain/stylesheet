# Beautiful. Flexible. Stupid Simple.

This is the homepage for `@jrgermain/stylesheet`, an NPM package that contains styles used in apps I build. The goal of this package is to create a common visual identity for my projects that isn't tied to a specific library or framework.

I designed this library with the following principles in mind:

- The websites I build must be **visually appealing**, **intuitive**, **accessible**, and **cohesive**.
- I want the flexibility to use the right tool for each job, which could mean different frameworks for different projects (or no framework at all).
- Use the platform wherever possible and minimize (preferably eliminate) JavaScript needed at runtime.
