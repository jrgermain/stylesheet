# Visually Hidden

You can use the class `visually-hidden` to make text visible to screen readers but hidden from sighted users. This allows you to add context for users who can't physically see the webpage without cluttering the design with additional text.

<p class="visually-hidden">
  This text is invisible, but will be read by screen readers.
