# App

The `App` component is really a collection of related components that, together, form the global layout of the page. They define the style and size of the global header, (optional) sidebar, and main content areas.

2 main layouts are supported: **standard** and **sidebar**. The app will use the standard layout by default, and will automatically switch to the sidebar layout if the page has a sidebar on it.

## App Root

The root element of your app should have the class `app`.

## App Header

## App Body

## App Sidebar
