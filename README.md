# Stylesheet

This repository contains the source code for a CSS stylesheet I use in my apps, as well as the documentation for that stylesheet.

The stylesheet is published to [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jrgermain/stylesheet), while the documentation site is live at https://stylesheet.jrgermain.dev/.

While I don't expect anyone else to use this, I'm publishing it to NPM so I can easily pull it into future projects, and maintaining docs to help my future self.
