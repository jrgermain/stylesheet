# Installation & Setup

## Installing the Stylesheet

There are multiple ways to add the stylesheet to your project. The most common setups are outlined below.

### Option 1: Using a Package Manager & Bundler

This option uses your package manager to download the stylesheet, and your project's existing build tooling to bundle it into the final output. This is the recommended approach if you're already using these tools.

First, install `@jrgermain/stylesheet` as a dependency. For example, if you're using NPM, you'd run the following command:

<CodeBlock
  language="sh"
  code="npm install @jrgermain/stylesheet"
/>

Next, in the entry point of your project (typically a file named root, index, or main), add the following import statements:

<CodeBlock
  language="js"
  code={trimTextPadding(`
    import "@jrgermain/stylesheet"; // Adds CSS styles
    import "@jrgermain/stylesheet/enhance"; // Adds UX enhancements
  `)}
/>

You might have to fiddle with the imports here. For example, the **enhance** script
(which needs to run in the browser) might need to be imported in a different file
than the main CSS stylesheet (which can be processed at build time).
You may also run into an issue where your build tooling can't resolve the first import
because it doesn't know to treat it as CSS. In this case, you can replace it with the
following equivalent import: `@jrgermain/stylesheet/stylesheet.css`.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

This option is useful if you aren't using a package manager or bundler.

First, go to the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/jrgermain/stylesheet/releases/latest). Expand the "Assets" section and download the `stylesheet-<version>.zip` file.

Next, extract the contents and copy them into your project. Note that the `.map` files are source maps, and are therefore optional.

Lastly, add a `<link>` tag and a `<script>` tag to your document head to reference the files you just copied.

<CodeBlock
  language="html"
  code={trimTextPadding(`
    <head>
      ...
      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/stylesheet.css" />
      <script src="/path/to/enhance.js" async></script>
      ...
    </head>
  `)}
/>

## Setup

### Recommended `head` Elements

It's recommended to set the `theme-color` meta tag. To do this, copy the following into your document `head`:

<CodeBlock
  language="html"
  code={trimTextPadding(`
    <meta name="theme-color" content="#fff" />
    <meta
      name="theme-color"
      media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
      content="#010203"
    />
  `)}
/>
