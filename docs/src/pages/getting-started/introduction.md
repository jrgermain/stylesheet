# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for my personal design system. This project is the result of over 2 years of learning, experimenting, and meticulously tweaking details. While I designed it to use in my own projects, it's open-source and MIT-licensed, so you can use it too.

I built this design system with the following principles in mind:

- Make applications **visually appealing**, **accessible**, and **cohesive**.
- Encourage simple, semantic HTML with modern elements like `dialog` and `details`.
- Embrace progressive enhancement and responsive design.
- Allow users to use whatever framework they prefer, or none at all.

The design system is written in pure CSS, plus a small script that provides some subtle enhancements to the user experience for users with JavaScript enabled.

This site includes documentation for the design tokens, components, and utility classes included in the design system, as well as instructions on how to get started.

_If you're new here, head over to the [Installation & Setup](/getting-started/installation-and-setup/) page to get started._
