## Visually Hidden (Screen Reader Only) Text
You can use the class `visually-hidden` to make text visible to screen readers but hidden from sighted users. This allows you to add context for users who can't physically see the webpage without cluttering the design with additional text.

<UsageExample
  name="Example"
  code={`
    <span class="visually-hidden">
      This text is only visible to screen readers.
    </span>
  `}
/>
