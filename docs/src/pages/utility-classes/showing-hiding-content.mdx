# Showing/Hiding Content

There are multiple classes that can be used to conditionally show or hide content based on the user's environment. These classes are useful for progressive enhancement and responsive design.

## Based on JavaScript Support

- To only show an item **when JavaScript is enabled** in the user's browser, add the class `if-js-enabled` to the element.

- To only show an item **when JavaScript is disabled** in the user's browser, add the class `if-js-disabled` to the element.

<br />
<div class="alert info">
  <div class="alert-content">These classes rely on the enhance script being run, so make sure to include it. See [installation and setup](/getting-started/installation-and-setup) for details.</div>
</div>

## Based on Viewport Size

- To only show an item **when the screen is wide**, add the class `if-wide-viewport` to the element.

- To only show an item **when the screen is a medium width**, add the class `if-medium-viewport` to the element.

- To only show an item **when the screen is narrow** (e.g., on an iPhone), add the class `if-narrow-viewport` to the element.

To show an element **at multiple viewport sizes**, simply combine the classes for your desired sizes. For example,
to show an item only on a narrow or medium viewport, use both classes: `if-narrow-viewport if-medium-viewport`.
Adding all 3 classes is equivalent to not adding any viewport classes at all; in either case, the element will
be visible at any viewport size.

<div style="max-width: 100%; overflow-x: auto;">
  <div
    style="
      background-color: var(--color-red-9);
      color: var(--color-red-3);
      border: var(--border-m) solid currentcolor;
      padding: var(--padding-m);
      width: 55rem;
      padding: var(--space-xs);
    "
  >
    <strong>Wide</strong>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em">The viewport is considered <q>wide</q> if it is at least as wide as this box.</p>
    <div
      style="
        background-color: var(--color-purple-9);
        color: var(--color-purple-3);
        border: var(--border-m) solid currentcolor;
        padding: var(--padding-m);
        width: 30rem;
        padding: var(--space-xs);
      "
    >
      <strong>Medium</strong>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9em">The viewport is considered <q>medium</q> if it is at least as wide as this box, but fits within the outer box.</p>
      <div
        style="
          background-color: var(--color-blue-9);
          color: var(--color-blue-3);
          border: var(--border-m) solid currentcolor;
          padding: var(--padding-m);
          width: 15rem;
          padding: var(--space-xs);
        "
      >
        <strong>Narrow</strong>
        <p style="font-size: 0.9em">The viewport is considered <q>narrow</q> if it fits inside the outer two boxes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

## Based on Application Layout

- To only show an item **when the application has a sidebar**, add the class `if-app-has-sidebar` to the element. Note that the sidebar doesn't have to be visible; it just has to be present in the layout.

## Examples

For each of the classes listed below, you will see a checkmark (✅) next to
the class's name if the condition is currently met.

Try resizing your browser window or turning JavaScript on/off to see how the
checkmarks change.

<div class="stack vertical">
  {[
    "if-js-enabled",
    "if-js-disabled",
    "if-narrow-viewport",
    "if-medium-viewport",
    "if-wide-viewport",
    "if-narrow-viewport if-medium-viewport",
    "if-medium-viewport if-wide-viewport",
    "if-app-has-sidebar",
  ].map((className) => (
    <div class="card secondary">
      <code>{className}</code>
      <span class={className}> ✅</span>
    </div>
  ))}
</div>
